# vulkan-tutorial-example


This is a code tutorial example for learning vulkan. These code examples are meant to be completely standalone with minimal libraries to handle the vulkan code itself.

Supposed to be used for learning and understanding working with the Vulkan API's.

These code examples are focused on being basic and minimal code to get topics working with vulkan.

**Disclaimer**: Before learning vulkan, if you are new to graphics programming and never done computer graphics. My recommendation to beginners is to learn OpenGL. LearnOpenGL.com is a good resource for getting started doing computer graphics. Reasons for this is because vulkan assumes you have some level of understanding of computer graphics and adds another layer of complexity to be able to get something as simple as a triangle.
